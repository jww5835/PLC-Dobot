## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to pick and place blocks using a DOBOT, Beaglebone Black, and PLC. This project incorparates computer vision and machine learning for determining the color of the block being picked up as well as comparing coordinate systems so the DOBOT knows where to pick up the block on the conveyor belt. 

There will also be labs involved for freshman/sophomore students to help them understand the basics of computer vision, machine learning, and PLC ladder logic.

## Included Files

All files provided are needed for use of the main file. The main file () is where the student will be doing some high level programming using our API (not developed yet). This API will simplify the programming allowing the student to grasp whats going on. This will lessen the learning curve allowing for growth and learning in the lab.

###### Tracking API (tracking.py)
This will allow the user to track objects on conveyor belt. This file should not be tampered with allows the Computer Vision to function properly.


###### DOBOT API (DobotDllType.py)

This will allow the user to control the Dobot. This file should not be tampered with as this is directly from the manufacturer.

###### Simplify API (Not Developed Yet)

This will use object oriented programming to simplify the code and allow the student to fully understand how everything works. More info will be provided once the development stage is complete.

###### Lab Files

We will provide 2 weeks worth of labs allowing the student to enjoy, learn, and work with the full system. These labs will be our provided but there will be many variations that can be created. Whether that entails making it more complicated or just including a new aspect to the labs. These will be provided after the Simplify API is completed.
