The goal of this project is to pick and place blocks using a DOBOT, Beaglebone Black, and PLC. This project incorparates computer vision and machine learning for determining the color of the block being picked up as well as comparing coordinate systems so the DOBOT knows where to pick up the block on the conveyor belt.

All files provided are needed for use of the main file. Such as the DOBOT API.
